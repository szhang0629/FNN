# Data Sets

## Simulation
 The SNP dataset for simulation is from the 1,000 Genome project. The data file is located in 
 ./ped.txt (Contains SNP values of various samples),
 ./info.txt (provides basic information of given data, including the SNP name, location relative location and non-zero frequency).

## Real Data Application 1
The dataset to be analyzed is from a large-scale genetic study of addiction: genetics and environment (SAGE). The data file is located in 
./Real1/g.csv (Contains SNP values)
./Real1/x.csv (contains auxillary variables such as sex, race, and age)
./Real1/y.csv (response variable, the maximum cigarettes used per day)

## Real Data Application 2
The dataset was obtained from the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The data file is located in 
./Real2/g.csv (Contains SNP values)
./Real2/y.csv (response variable brain value at the test age)
