# FNN

## Preprocess
shows how we deal preprocess the UCSF data before applying our FNN model.

## Data
contains all the dataset we used in our paper. Since the file "ped.txt" exceeds the file size limit, we compress it in a zip file. Please unzip it before you test the data.

## Code
gives the core functions of our model. The "main.R" gives the access of our FNN model, while the "main_.R" realizes the vanilla neural networks model for comparison.

## Process
presents our computation results of simulation and real data analysis.
